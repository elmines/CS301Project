New User
INSERT INTO AccountUser (Username, Email Address, Password)
If they enter a manager password
	INSERT INTO Manager(Username)
	Something like select managerPassword from SystemInfo 
If they do not enter a manager password
	INSERT INTO AccountUser(Username)
Log in Screen
Select Username from Customer
	If it is not there they should be able to click on register
Select Username from Manager
	Will return 0 tuples if not a manager
Select Username, Password from AccountUser where (Username = Username AND Password = Password)
	This will return 0 tuples if the username/password combination does not exist in the database ? should show an error message in this case
My Order History (Me Page)
Select( OrderID, MovieName, Status, Cost) from TicketOrder 
	JOIN SHOWING on TicketOrder.ShowingID = Showing.ID
SELECT Title, Body, Rating FROM Review WHERE MovieName = MovieName
Give Review (Give a review for a specific movie that you have seen)
INSERT INTO REVIEW (ID, Username, MovieName, Title, Body, Rating)
	I think the ID will be autogenerated? So like a global variable type thing that you increment when you add a  new review

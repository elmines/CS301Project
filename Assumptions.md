# Simplifying Assumptions
- Treat Customer/Manager pages as static HTML
- There is only one manager password for creating manager accounts
- All movies have different names. For example, if we have both "Ocean's 11" movies, we identify them as "Ocean's 11 -- 1960" and "Ocean's 11 -- 2001"
- Movie lengths are recorded in minutes.

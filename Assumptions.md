# Simplifying Assumptions
- Treat Customer/Manager pages as static HTML
- There is only one manager password for creating manager accounts
- All movies have different names. For example, if we have both "Ocean's 11" movies, we identify them as "Ocean's 11 -- 1960" and "Ocean's 11 -- 2001." This also includes 3D and IMAX variations of movies.
- Movie lengths are recorded in minutes.
- Multiple customers can have the same credit card; for example, two spouses could have separate accounts but the same credit card.
- Managers' reports are computed from the database entities--they need not be represented as entities themselves.
